# pandas-challenge

-During this challenge most of the material referenced came from rewatching lectures as well as assistance during office hours

-The final file with code submitted was the finish product of the startcode that was given for us to use. Most of the code for initializing each section of the .ipynb file such as the path to the csvfiles was used from the starter code. code was also mostly taken from inclass activities and can be found throughout the final file submitted for grading.

-Finaly chatGPT was used when further explinations or quick definitions where needed for a lot of the pandas methods used during this challenge. GPT was also useful for finding the correct syntax and formating of columns in certain dataframes if it was not already given in the starter code. As a side note, GPT was actualy very useful when errors would populate especially for when they were simple erorrs that I had overlooked like running a cell above my current cell to initialize a variable.
